# Final-Year-Project
My final year project is focused on estimating the impact of parliamentary speeches using sentiment analysis, on agriculture food prices during the Great Irish Famine.

This repository focuses on conducting sentiment analysis using a dictionary based approach. The textual corpus involves speeches from the British and Irish joint parliament for the period 1835-1860. The general inquirer (GI) dictionary was used as the general dictionary for this analysis.

The output of this program creates 3 excel files:
(1) Sentiment results on a yearly basis
(2) Sentiment results on a bimonthly basis
(3) Sentiment results by speaker
